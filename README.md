#Advanced Image Editor - Cartoonizer and Favicon Generator
Project Overview
The Advanced Image Editor is a web-based application built using Flask (Python framework) that allows users to upload images, apply a cartoon effect, and generate a favicon.ico for their website. This project provides two primary functionalities:

##Cartoon Effect: Users can upload an image and customize it with a cartoon effect by adjusting parameters such as line size, blur value, and the number of colors. The image is then processed and displayed as a cartoon.

##Favicon Generator: Users can upload any image, and the application will resize and convert it to a favicon.ico, which can be used as a browser icon for websites.

The app is built with Flask for the back-end and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The cartoon effect is implemented using OpenCV and Pillow for image processing.

##Features
Image Upload: Upload an image to the application for processing.
Cartoon Effect: Apply a cartoon effect with customizable parameters such as line size, blur, and the number of colors.
Favicon Generator: Convert any uploaded image into a 16x16 pixel favicon.ico.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring that it works well on desktop and mobile devices.
Preview: Real-time preview of the image after applying the cartoon effect.
Flask-based: Lightweight web server using Flask, serving the web app and handling image processing.
